            The Witcher universe is saturated with unusual creatures and magic,
            but only a select few are able to wield its tremendous power -
            including Geralt. While mages are able to harness the chaos with
            adept skill, acutely aware of the balance between give-and-take,
            Geralt’s magic powers differ somewhat. Instead of casting full
            spells, Geralt is able to perform weaker magic, known as Signs.

              A master swordsman, a fully trained witcher into fight against
              monsters. A Witcher carries two swords - but only wields one at a
              time, so the other hand is free to cast signs.

            <p>
              witchers can cast simple magic spells that can prove effective
              when used properly. Witchers call these spells signs and usually
              use them against monsters.

              <h1>Aard</h1>
              <p>
                When Geralt casts Aard, he can emit a blast of telekinetic
                energy to stun, knock down, or push back any opponent in his
                way. But the sign isn’t only used against people or monsters. He
                can also use it to destroy any object or obstacles in his path.
                This Sign is particularly useful in combat when he has to fight
                multiple creatures or people at once. When everyone attacks at
                the same time, he can use Aard to give a momentary pause in the
                fighting and disorient his opponents.

            <div class="skills-info">
              <h1>Igni</h1>
              <p>
                This is a powerful Sign that allows Geralt to inflict fire
                damage to his enemies. When casting Igni, a stream of fire
                ejects from his hands, lighting monsters on fire and melting
                armor. It can also be used passively to light lanterns for dark
                caverns. Igni is another essential Sign to use during combat. It
                not only lowers the health of any opponent, but has a lasting
                effect. Depending on the target, the creature or person could
                remain on fire for multiple seconds, allowing Geralt enough time
                to land an undefended attack.

              <h1>Yrden</h1>
              <p>
                Ydren is somewhat different from the other Signs Geralt can
                cast. This one is used as a kind of magical trap, which can
                snare and stun opponents. It can also slow then down to give
                Geralt enough time to attack. To fight some of the monsters
                throughout the Continent, this Sign is required in order to do
                any kind of damage to them. It’s only when Geralt casts Yrden
                and the creature steps into the trap that his attacks inflict
                any damage.
              </p>

              <h1>Quen</h1>
              <p>
                Geralt can cast this Sign as a defensive measure. Quen creates a
                protective forcefield around his body that blocks any damage
                coming from his enemies. It will last until it has absorbed the
                maximum amount of damage it can take. Strong, offensive action
                is mandatory in combat but defensive measures are also
                necessary. If Geralt is fighting many opponents at once, or
                fighting against someone stronger than himself, casting Quen is
                the best way to prevent taking too much damage.

              <h1>Axii</h1>
              <p>
                Axii can be cast inside and outside of combat, especially when
                interacting with people before missions. This Sign is used to
                charm someone’s mind, allowing Geralt to influence their
                decision making. This Sign is very useful when dealing with
                people that refuse to divulge information, but it also has its
                limitations. While Geralt can force someone to talk to him with
                Axii, it only works on one or two people at a time. A larger
                group of people will notice him using magic and will react
                unfavorably.
